# Catala-specific questions

<div id="tocw"></div>

## When to choose `condition`, `rule` *vs* booleans?

You may have noticed the keywords `condition` and `rule` in Catala scopes,
for instance:

```catala-code-en
declaration scope Foo:
  input i content integer
  output x condition

scope Foo:
  rule x under condition i = 42 consequence fulfilled
```

The above is strictly equivalent to the following program:

```catala-code-en
declaration scope Foo:
  input i content integer
  output x content boolean

scope Foo:
  definition x equals false

  exception definition x under condition i = 42 consequence equals true
```

As the example shows, `condition` is a [syntactic sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar)
for declaring a boolean scope variable whose default value is `false`. In the body
of the scope, you must use `rule` instead of `definition` for defining under which
conditions the `condition` should be `fulfilled` (`true`) or `not fulfilled` (`false`).
It is possible to use `exception` and `label` on rules like for definitions,
but all the `rule`s are implicitly exceptions of a base case where the condition
is `false`.

This behavior for `condition` and `rule` matches the legal intuition, making this
syntax easier to read for pieces of programs with complex code to set a boolean
variable.

## Why do I have to cast values?

Some programming languages, like Javascript, do not make any distinction between
decimals and integers (there is a unique `Number` type). In others, like Python,
the distinction is hidden because the compiler or interpreter inserts implicit
casts whenever you use an integer when a decimal was needed. This approach eases
programming as you do not need to worry how the number is represented in memory,
things just *work*.

However, this approach has a downside, precisely because the language decides
for you how the number is represented in memory. The downside is that you are
not in control of how precise the computations are, and how values are casted
from one representation to another. For instance, when casting a decimal to an
integer, you will lose precision because of rounding or truncating; there are
multiple ways to convert a number of months into a number of days depending on
what you are computing.

The philosophy of Catala is to give you full control over those choices, at
the expense of require explicit casting. Hence, Catala's base types (`boolean`,
`integer`, `decimal`, `money`, `date`, `duration`) strictly distinct and require
explicit casting between them. Using a `decimal` where an `integer` is needed
will yield a type error like the following:

```text
┌─[ERROR]─
│
│  I don't know how to apply operator + on types integer and decimal
│
├─➤ example.catala_en:
│    │
│ 13 │   1 + 2.0
│    │   ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
│
│ Type integer coming from expression:
├─➤ example.catala_en:
│    │
│ 13 │  1 + 2.0
│    │  ‾
│
│ Type decimal coming from expression:
├─➤ example.catala_en:
│    │
│ 13 │   1 + 2.0
│    │       ‾‾‾
└─
```

This error can be fixed by tweaking `2.0` to `integer of 2.0`. See the
relevant section of the [language reference](./5-2-types.md#base-types) for more
details about how to create literals with the correct type.

## Why is there a distinct money type?

Correctly performing financial computations is hard. The precision and rounding
rules required may vary from application to application, and should be balanced
with performance requirements.

This is why Catala separates strictly the `money` type from `integer`s or
`decimal`s. Using `money` values in Catala, along with explicit casting (see
above), lets the compiler warn you when you're mixing money and non-money
numbers in your computation. Money, and the currency unit, becomes like a
dimensional unit in a physical formula that needs to check out coherently.

Once that we have these separate `money` value, we have to give them a behavior
that accommodates most uses and respects the philosophy of the language. Hence,
`money` values in Catala are a integer number of cents. Multiplying a `money`
value by a `decimal` can yield a value that is not an exact number of cent;
in that case Catala rounds the result to the nearest cent.

If you want more precision for values representing money amount, you should
represent them as `decimal` and cast them in (with the occasional rounding) and
out of `money` when you need to.


## How to round money up or down to a specific precision?

In Catala, monetary values are represented as an integer number of cents (see
above). A calculation with the catala `money` type always result in an amount
rounded to the nearest cent. This means, that, when performing intermediate
computations on money, rounding must be considered by the programmer at each
step. This aims at making review by domain experts easier, since for each
intermediate value, they can follow along and perform example computations with
a simple desk calculator.

To round to the nearest monetary unit, use `round of`. To round an
amount to an arbitrary multiple of a cent, you may use the [dedicated
helper functions](./5-7-standard-library.md#module-money) present in
the Catala standard library ([section 5-7](./5-7-standard-library.md)).
For instance, `Money.round_by_excess of $4.13` yields `$5`,
`Money.round_by_default of $4.13` yields `$4`. And, if one needs to
round to the nearest 10 cents, you can use `Money.round_to_decimal of
$123.45, 1 = $123.5` where `1` defines the `n-th` decimal to round
on. If a negative number is provided, you may round on the amount
before the decimal part. For example, `Money.round_to_decimal of
$123.45, -2 = $100.0` rounds to the nearest hundred of monetary unit.

These helper functions are also available for `decimal` values in the
dedicated [standard library
module](./5-7-standard-library.md#module-decimal).

## Why mathematical integers and decimals instead of machine integers and floats?

Precision! Machine integers have a maximum and minimum value and wrap on overflow
or underflow. Floating-point values cannot represent arbitrary small intervals
between numbers and lose precision by accumulating errors, computation after
computation. These weaknesses are usually ignored by computer scientists, as
machine integers and floating points are precise enough for most applications,
but financial computations for automatic administrative decision-making should not
fail, even rarely, due to these low-level problems.

Hence, Catala uses the [GMP](https://gmplib.org/) library to feature true
mathematically sound integers and decimal values whose representation in memory
grows as more and more precision is needed from them. This choice adds some
performance overhead but GMP includes state-of-the-art optimizations tailored
for every architecture using assembly tricks to lower or even cancel this
overhead for computations that don't really require the extra precision.

For instance and under the hood, Catala's `decimal` are actually GMP rationals,
irreducible fractions made of two GMP infinite-precision integers.

## How to create dates and durations from integers?

To get a duration, simply multiply the desired duration unit by the integer or decimal:

```catala-code-en
# 1 month * 24 = 24 month

declaration duration_of_days content duration
  depends on number_of_days content integer
  equals
    1 day * number_of_days
```

However, you cannot build a `YYYY-MM−DD` by directly concatenating together the
`integer` values of `YYYY-MM-DD`. Instead, use the `Date.of_year_month_day`
function.

## Why are there no strings?

The absence of strings in Catala is *a feature, not a bug*. Catala is meant to
be a domain-specific programming language for computations described in legal
texts, that lawyers understand. If you find a legal text that requires actual
string manipulation operations to be automated, please tell the Catala team!
In absence of such a legal text, the decision was made to not include strings,
for several reasons.

First, the common operations present in legal texts that can be done with
strings, can also be done better with other Catala features. For instance, it is
better to represent tags and codes with `enumeration`s that can contain payload
and have a built-in exhaustiveness check in pattern matching. The Catala team
thus advises you to really think your problem through and see whether it really
requires strings as a first-class value type in Catala to be solved.

Second, the preferred way of performing low-level, computation-intensive
operations not described by legal text but used in a Catala program is to simply
do them outside of Catala and provide their output as inputs of a Catala scope,
or define an external module. See the [language reference for more
details](./5-6-modules.md#declaring-external-modules).

Third, including string manipulations in the Catala runtime will heavily
increase the size and complexity of the runtime, as it will probably require a
fully-fledged regexp library as a dependency. Moreover, this regexp library dependency
should be available in every backend programming language that Catala supports,
to ensure that the semantics of string operations is absolutely the same whatever
the backend. This is a lot of work and later, maintenance, for the Catala team.

## How do I add an exception from *outside* a scope?

Sometimes, the law is quite convoluted. For instance, [article 1731
bis](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000044981364) of
the French tax code describes how to compute fines for tax fraud or late income
declaration. This article specifies that, when computing the fine amount, the
main tax computation should be tweaked to neutralize certain deductions. If you
were to implement this in Catala, you would have two scopes `FinesComputation`
and `IncomeTaxComputation`; article 1731 bis requires you to call
`IncomeTaxComputation` from `FinesComputation` while tweaking certain
computation rules inside `IncomeTaxComputation`.

This pattern amounts to declaring an exception to a variable of
`IncomeTaxComputation`, from the outside of `IncomeTaxComputation`. Turns out
there is a specific Catala feature to handle this case, extending the
`exception`s in a principled way across scopes : context variables. See the
[language reference for more details](./5-3-scopes-toplevel.md#context-variables).

## Do I have to repeat every field in a struct when I want to only change one of them?

No! See "Updating structs" in the [language reference for more
details](./5-5-expressions.md#structures).

## How are dates and durations handled?

What is the result of `Jan 31st + 1 month`? Is it Feb 28th, Feb 29th or March
1st? This question reveals the subtle tricks behind date computations in the
Gregorian calendar. The variable number of days in a month and leap years cause
ambiguities in many date computations specified in the law. The way these
ambiguities are resolved influences the outcome of administrative automated
decisions, which is why the Catala team has been very cautious about this topic.
The motivations and design choices are outlined in a [scientific
article](https://hal.science/hal-04536403); in summary a [custom date
computation library](https://github.com/CatalaLang/dates-calc) that lets the
user choose how to round ambiguous dates computations had to be implemented.

Otherwise, dates in Catala are standard dates in the Gregorian calendar, precise
to the day (and not more). Durations are a combination of a number of days,
months and/or years. See the [language reference](./5-2-types.md#dates) for more
details.

## How do I compare a difference of two dates with a duration?

When comparing the length of a period of time
(e.g., from a person's birth date to today),
it may feel natural to compute the difference between the two dates,
then compare it to a duration.
However, since the difference of two dates always yields
a duration expressed in days
(see the [language reference](./5-2-types.md#durations)),
it cannot be compared to a number of months or years.

For instance, `current_date - date_of_birth >= 18 year`
is not a valid expression.
In that case, the number of months or years should not be transformed manually
into a number of days (e.g., `18 * 365 day`).
Instead, use Catala's date and period addition, and date comparison:
`current_date >= date_of_birth + 18 year`.
This is what the
[Date module of the standard library](5-7-standard-library.md#date-comparisons)
does in functions such as `is_old_enough_rounding_down`.

## Which programming languages can Catala target?

The Catala compiler natively targets :
* C (standard C89);
* Python;
* Java;
* OCaml;

From the OCaml backend, Javascript can be targeted through
[`js_of_ocaml`](https://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/latest/manual/overview).

The [runtimes for these
backends](https://github.com/CatalaLang/catala/tree/master/runtimes) have two
dependencies outside the standard library of the target programming languages:
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/) for multi-precision arithmetic and our [custom date
computation library](https://github.com/CatalaLang/dates-calc).


## Why scope declarations cannot be split like scope definitions ?

In Catala, there can be [multiple `definition`s for the same scope
variable](./5-4-definitions-exceptions.md). This allows for splitting the code
defining the value of a variable along the bits of specification scattered
across the legal text. Following this logic, one might want to be able to split
scope or data structure `declaration`s  across the codebase in the same way,
thereby justifying the presence of each particular input or internal scope
variable by a bit of legal text. Such a feature would be reminiscent of
extensible types, a feature present in languages like
[OCaml](https://ocaml.org/manual/extensiblevariants.html).

However, the Catala team chose not to implement such a feature. Indeed,
empirical experiments showed that contrary to `definition`s which should always
be justified by the legal specification, the choice of how to arrange data
structures and scope prototype is largely up to the programmer, and a lot of it
is rather motivated by programming constraints than legal requirements. This is
why the Catala team advises programmers to put all data structure and scope
declarations inside a "prologue" section distinct from the legal sources, rather
than scattering them across the codebase.

Furthermore, having all data structure and scope declarations unified and at the
same place is helpful during programming since the programmer always know where
to look to find these declarations. Of course, advanced tooling in development
environments propose the "Go to declaration" feature that could alleviate this
problem, but this advanced tooling might not always be available to users
outside the development team that still want to read and understand the program.
